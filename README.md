# Analyzing-Toronto-

Analyzing Toronto's Neighborhood with the following information,

1. Toronto's Postal code and Neighborhoods
2. Population Information -> Total income in household
3. Crime Rate -> Homicide 

We took the city of Toronto and segmented it into separate neighborhoods based on their
geological coordinates. The neighborhoods will then be grouped into clusters using a
combination of location data from the Foursquare API and artificial intelligence (clustering).


The correlation between the population information and crime rate in Toronto.
